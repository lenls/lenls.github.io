LENLS is an annual international conference on formal linguistics (i.e., syntax, semantics 
and pragmatics), computational linguistics, the philosophy of language, and related fields, including but 
not limited to the following:

- Formal syntax, semantics and pragmatics of natural language
- Model-theoretic and/or proof-theoretic semantics of natural language
- Computational approaches to semantics and pragmatics
- Nonclassical logic and its relation to natural language (e.g. substructural, fuzzy, categorical, and topological logic)
- Formal philosophy of language
- Scientific methodology and/or experimental design in linguistics

LENLS20 is scheduled to take place in a in-person format (with a physical presence in Osaka), but with a limited option for a virtual presence via zoom. 



Submissions:
============
Authors are required to choose from one of the following two submission categories: [Abstract Only]
and [Abstract+Full Paper].  For both categories, authors must submit abstracts (anonymous, 
up to 4 pages including figures and references, A4 size, 12-point font) on original, 
unpublished research.  Abstracts must be submitted electronically in PDF at:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lenls20

Upon acceptance, authors (both categories) are expected to submit extended 
abstracts (up to 5 pages) before the workshop.  Note that abstracts submitted to the [Abstract+Full Paper] 
category may be accepted in the [Abstract Only] category (but not vice versa).  The proceedings of 
the workshop will be made available online, including extended abstracts (both categories).

Authors submitting to the [Abstract+Full Paper] category are required to submit a full paper (up to 14 pages) 
for the post-proceedings volume after the conference and must agree to review at least one other full 
paper.


Selected Papers:
================
LENLS20 is held under the umbrella of The Association for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI).  The collection of full papers will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, in accordance with the contract between Springer Nature Switzerland AG and The Association for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI).

Code of Conduct:
================
All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to adhire to the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.

[The Quick Version] 
The organizers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, and social media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the organisers.

Participants asked to stop harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference without a refund.
If you experience harassment, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the following conference staff members immediately: Elin McCready and Daisuke Bekki
THe conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
