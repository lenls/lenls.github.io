Dear Daisuke Bekki,

The paper selection meeting will be held online (Zoom) on 1 October (Sun) from 14:00 to 17:00 (JST).  If you can make it, we would be glad if you could join us (even partially).  The Zoom URL is below:

This year, we received up to 46 submissions, the largest number ever.
We are sorry that, as a result, we have to ask you to review more papers than before.  We have already received many insightful peer reviews, for which we are very grateful.  Thanks to your support, LENLS20 in Osaka will be an event that will attract many people, including ourselves.
