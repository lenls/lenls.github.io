Dear [*NAME*]:

We have three announcements for LENLS20 PC members.

1.  The first version of the program is now available.

https://lenls.github.io/lenls20/

We have allocated a session chair to each session based on the availability described on the registration form.  The program is still subject to change, but please check it.


2.  Registration information can be found at

https://lenls.github.io/lenls20/#registration

This year (as with previous LENLS before COVID-19), the registration fee will be collected in cash on-site.  There is no charge for online-only participants, so if you did not register recently, we encourage you to register online.

If you are attending in person and would like to participate in the conference dinner, please note that October 30 is the deadline.


3.  I have set up a discord server for LENLS20 participants.  Please join us.

https://discord.gg/eXpuJUWu

This is where we will be asking questions about the presentations, sharing information about lodging and transportation, inviting each other for drinks, etc.
