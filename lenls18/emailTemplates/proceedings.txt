Dear [*NAME*],

We intend to produce a set of online proceedings in time for the conference.  You have already received the comments from the reviewers in a previous email.  Please take them carefully into account when preparing your camera-ready paper for the online proceedings. 

To submit your paper (up to 14 pages in length) in PDF format, please log in to EasyChair, and from the "Submission [*PAPER-ID*]" menu, follow the "Update file" link there.

[*CONFERENCE-LINK*]

Please follow the Springer LNCS format:

The camera-ready paper is due on

   **October 29 (Fri), 23:59 (JST)**

This is a firm deadline for the production of the proceedings.

After the conference, we plan to select papers from the proceedings of [*ACRONYM*] to publish a post-conference proceedings as a volume in the LNAI series of Springer Verlag.  If you do not submit to the proceedings, your paper will not be considered for this volume.

We greatly appreciate your cooperation in these matters. Thank you again for your contribution to [*ACRONYM*].


Sincerely,

[*ACRONYM*] committee
