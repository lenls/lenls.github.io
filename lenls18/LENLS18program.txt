LENLS is an annual international workshop on formal syntax, semantics 
and pragmatics. It will be held as one of the workshops of the
JSAI International Symposia on AI (JSAI-isAI2021)
(https://www.ai-gakkai.or.jp/isai/)
sponsored by the Japan Society for Artificial Intelligence (JSAI).

Note that LENLS 18 attendance has changed to being **Online** only.
Plans for having a physical presence option for attendance have been abandoned
in line with the decision made by the organisers of JSAI-isAI2021 to hold the Symposia online only.



Aims and Topics:
================
We invite submissions to this year's workshop on topics in formal
syntax, semantics and pragmatics, and related fields, including but in no way
limited to the following:

- Formal syntax, semantics and pragmatics of natural language
- Model-theoretic and/or proof-theoretic semantics of natural language
- Computational Semantics
- Game-theoretic/Bayesian approaches to pragmatics
- Nonclassical Logic and its relation to natural language (especially Substructural/Fuzzy/Categorical/Topological logics)
- Formal Philosophy of language
- Scientific methodology and/or experimental design for linguistics


Submissions:
============
Abstracts (anonymous, up to 4 pages, including figures and references, 
A4 size, with 12 point font) must be submitted electronically in PDF format at:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lenls18

When the abstract is accepted, the author is expected to submit an extended abstract or a full paper (up to 14 pages) before the workshop. The online proceedings of the workshop will be available online.

Selected Papers:
================
We also plan to publish a selection of the accepted/invited papers
as a portion of a volume "JSAI-isAI selected papers", which will  
be published from `Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence' series
(Springer Verlag). 

Important dates:
================
Deadline for camera-ready copy: October 29, 2021, 23:59 (in JST)
LENLS18: November 13(Sat), 14(Sun), and 15(Mon), 2021
