Dear [*NAME*],

Online proceedings
==================
We intend to produce online proceedings for the LENLS19 conference.  Please prepare a revised version of your abstract in PDF (unanonymized, up to 4 pages including figures and references, A4 size, 12-point font, without page numbers).

To submit an abstract, just update your file on the LENLS19 EasyChair site (https://www.easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lenls19):

- log in to the EasyChair site as an author
- select your submission from the menu bar
- follow the "Update file" link there
- upload and submit your PDF file

The submission is due on

   **October 14 (Fri) 23:59 (in JST)**

The online proceedings will be made available for the registered participants.  Note that:

- The online proceedings differ from the post-proceedings to be published by FoLLI, for which we will send a separate instruction to the authors of the [Abstract+Full paper] category.
- The online proceedings will not be assigned an ISBN/ISSN.
