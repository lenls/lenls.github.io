Dear [*NAME*]:

We are sorry to inform you that the following submission for the  
upcoming [*ACRONYM*] was not selected by the program committee: 

[*PAPER-ID*]: [*TITLE*]

The selection process was very competitive. Due to time and space 
limitations, we could only choose a small number of the submitted 
papers to appear on the program.  Nonetheless, we still hope that 
you can attend the conference. 


Best regards,

[*ACRONYM*] committee
