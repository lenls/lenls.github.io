for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI)

LENLS19 is scheduled to take place in a hybrid format, that is, with both a physical presence 
option in Tokyo and a virtual presence option via zoom, while monitoring the global COVID-19 pandemic.

We also plan to publish a selection of the accepted/invited papers
as a portion of a volume "JSAI-isAI selected papers", which will  
be published from `Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence' series
(Springer Verlag).
