and pragmatics), computational linguistics, the philosophy of language, and related fields, including but 
not limited to the following:</p>
<topics>
<topic>Formal syntax, semantics and pragmatics of natural language</topic>
<topic>Model-theoretic and/or proof-theoretic semantics of natural language</topic>
<topic>Computational approaches to semantics and pragmatics</topic>
<topic>Nonclassical logic and its relation to natural language (especially substructural, fuzzy, categorical, 
and topological logic)</topic>
<topic>Formal philosophy of language</topic>
<topic>Scientific methodology and/or experimental design in linguistics</topic>
</topics>
<p>We are happy to announce that from this year, LENLS will be held under the umbrella of <host url="http://www.folli.info/">The Association for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI)</host>.  LENLS19 is scheduled to take place in a hybrid format, that is, with both a physical presence option in Tokyo and a virtual presence option via zoom, while monitoring the global COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

for the post-proceedings volume after the conference and must agree to review at least one other full 
paper.</p>
